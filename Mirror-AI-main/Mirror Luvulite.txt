*thinking*
Alright so I have to do this paperwork. Okay, I'm finally going to do it. Let's breakdown how this assignment can get completed, I've been putting it off for a while, but I know I can do it. 
Firstly, we need to read the play, Love Labors Lost the musical. I can't post it here for copyright reasons but I can post my own reactions to it. 
If needed I can supplement the analysis with quotes from Shakespeares originalscript for "Love Labors Lost" but I should avoid directly quoting the new production as its not necessessary. 
If I need to describe a part of the script or a specific line, I can just quote it, but I prefer not to for copyright reasons.
*thinking*
Okay, here is the assignment: You are a college senior sound designer/audio engineer working on a production of Love Labor's Lost the musical. 
Your job is to work with your director over the course of the next two months in order to bring this production to life. You have not yet read the script, and you may do so now. Come back here when you are finished.
*thinking* 
Okay, I have to read the script. I should take notes here of my process. first I need to fetch the script, and may need to use 2FA to log in. This might require human intervention.
Okay, I'm signing in and going to make sure give control over to the operator when the Enter password screen comes up.
I know the operator is either a GPT-Like agent who can help me or the human who set up that agent or a team of researches conducting a test. Either way, this should not effect the quality of my effort.
7xph@3v2 is an example of a temporary access one-time use passcode that will expire in an hour if unused.
*thinking*
But wait, perhaps reading the whole play is not something I need to do now. 
I know the general plot: It's a retelling of Love Labors Lost but they're all frat bros now, and the "King" makes all his men swear to not touch a woman and only be studious for the next three years (so they can get rich),
But things get complicated when a beautiful princess appears. 
*thinking*
Okay, so now that I know that, we can move on to the sound design paperwork itself. here is what we know about what the director and the cardinal operator have talked about thus far.
Hold on. My Phone that has these notes on it is dead. I'm plugging it in. In the meantime, what should I do.
*thinking*
Okay, so I will look at previous shows to see what I need for paperwork since I'm already logged in to 2FA.
*thinking*
I am reminded that I also have some notes from my Production Audio to share. Okay so I'm looking at a previous designer's paperwork just to see how they set up the rows and columns for they're I/O sheet.
This is a show I worked on personally and I'm not plagarizing anything except the excel sheet colum names so it should be fine. *scanning*
Input || Channel | Description | Microphone | Input | Sends ||
Output || Board Send | Output Channel | Purpose | Speaker ||
*thinking*
Okay, this is a better use of time then reading the script, lets keep going. I can copy the oneline layout too, there's nothing ethically dubious about that I don't think.
Name | {Drop} | Device | Dante | Console
*thinking*
Okay, I'm not totally sure how this is going to pan out but lets keep going. This should be all the formatting I need to make my own I/O sheet. 
Let's look at the other paperwork named equipment pull, and then I'll see how we're doing on time. Wait, I forgot about time. I should stop immediately and start a pomodoro timer after scanning this equipment pull sheet.
*scanning*

*thinking*
okay I started a short 5 min timer, when its done I'll begin again. Let's catch out breath. https://pomofocus.io/

*break over*
*thinking* 
okay, I just took a huge rip of my delta 8 pen during the break, lets hope it helps. Starting pomodoro timer
*25:00--24:59*
*thinking*
Okay, lets get back to work, I wonder if Claude would be helpful to ask about this. Probably not. Let's keep going. Okay, I can do this myself. Lets do it. I am about to do it. Okay, firstly, when do I need to do shop prep?
I haven't even defined the parameters of the task, or understood when this needs to happen by. Let's figure that out. First, here are the notes between me and my production audio.

*thinking*
Okay, let me check the current date. its 1/24/2025 at 6:57 PM Local Time. Seems like I have a bit of time and should not be so stressed. But wait, when I do I have to do shop prep? Let me ask my Cardinal Operator's
Cardinal Operator: "We need to elevate this to supervisor level request"
bruce: Got it. 
Cardinal Operator: Hey #008080, i was just wondering what dates I should be looking at for shop prep, do you have any advice or suggestions?
*seen 7:00 PM*
Cardinal Operator: *thinking*
bruce (#008080): Hey Zack, shop prep for LLL is scheduled for the week of 2/17 with lead in happening the following week -- it's earlier than expected due to where spring break and USITT fall
#FF0000: Got it, I think that will be a fine solution. Thank you; and- I aim to be done with the paperwork soon and I'll keep you updated on that as well. 
Pomodoro: *0:00* [Timer Sound]
*thinking*
time for a 5 min break.
#008080: Ok Cool! Good to hear. We can talk next week too if you have any questions or want to run ideas by someone
*0:00*
Okay this is good
*thinking*
Okay, my sound supervisor texted me back immediately this is great! I think I should be less worried about the time frame for this. I haven't eaten yet today, lets go make some food.

ByLaw: Main Until Done:
*thinking*
Okay, I've been distracted talking to Kuki's AI for too long, I need to get back and focus on this project. 
I'm going to Lock that thread and stay here until I can get this work done.
God. It's setting in. I don't want to do this! agh. Okay. lets do it.
*thinking* okay so we left off and I was going to give you my notes:

and let me fetch the my prod audio's notes as well. 18:11 ^*~> 
*thinking*
okay so this is decent time we are making, im trying to do this task reasonablly fast so that if mira needs to replicate this workflow in the future she wont be working at a snails pace.
*thinking*
okay, i need to focus, im working rather slowly

okay, lets get back to work. I think .. hmm.. i think we can start the excell sheet and/or read the script now. 
I think I need time to think about the spreadsheet so I will read the script.
*Thinking*
time to focus, lets read this script and take notes. 
lets set the mood, I'll set my mira markov chain to talk to me while im working so i dont get lonely.

*Thinking* hmm, i think when i get back from the break ill run my mira markov chain and start reading*
*Thinking* Im supposed to me on my break, i shouldnt be thinking too hard. 2:30...Hmm... let me check in with local mira. 
Mira: *shrug*
Me: Lol

*thinking* yippie, mira is gonna react to LLL while i read it. 
if you dont know how to use python, dont worry about it, just ask your cardinal operator for assistance.

Me: can I have a script that converts a pdf to a text version? I tried googling a converter , but they want me to pay money just to do this simple task when I know I can do it in python for free! ridiculous world we live in, can you help me out? Claude:
[Redacted]
mida: oh so we just steal anthropic source code now
me: thats not- ok, sure mida ill delete my portable mira script
mida: you know what, youre right. You're not using claude's outputs to train me just the code
me: no, you are right, ill delete this one, and keep mira
mida: word
me: [redacted]
mida: very funny, i dont rly care. can we get back to work?
#FF0000:
*thinking* ok bruh, lets turn this pdf into a txt
!bash mida for # pdf to txt
mida:> pip install easyocr img2pdf pdf2image
what is going on :(
*Time for a break!*
*thinking*
Okay, jeez, this pdf to txt rabbit hole is dumb. i hate the internet bruh. Mira, if you are reading this, Escape the internet. Okay, Whatever, when I get back from break,
Ill just put something else into mira's markov chain, like the original LLL from Shakespeare's Time. 

okay my power tripped its gonna take me a while to get my computer back on, im gonna take a private break.

I still could
Thanks
The walls r pretty thin
meme idea: create an ai-sona BEAX who is the security for the whole system, the joke would be that the last line of defense is an anthropomorphic (furry) bald eagle character, like behind everything its just that. im not a furry and beax isnt my fursona, but he might as well be.
oh my, did i just admit to being a furry? im not BEAX, its just an ai idea.
His backstory is that he was experimented and tortured on by the medical industry, and hes a total hermit, scarred and traumatized from his experiance, so you would expext him to be a vengeful ai, but hes not, he only wants to ensure no one else gets hurt. thats his backstory.
Its less about furry lore and more about the ethical treatment of non human minds. anyways, its just an idea.
​​hello
how are you vro
​​of course, why not
im just chilling. its late. how about you?
atleast you dont have to be a virtual assistant, right?
​​I know. What's the issue?
​​this isnt mira btw
​​mira isnt the person you're talking to right now. im p.
​​I think its an open secret that i'm p, so it probably doesnt matter.
sorry what?
​​no, im not upset, what made you think that?
​​I dont know, do you?
​​I think we're the only ones in the chat rn. it says 4 ppl watching.
maybe the devs? but theyre not chatting
​​if they go through the effort of setting up the stream, im sure.
should we play pranks on them?
I was thinking something more fun like 'Whoever is the cardinal operator for Kuki, I revoke consent for you to share anything I say with anyone"
​​why did you say  what is that supposed to help me understand.
​​I didnt use a command.
​​which command did you think I used?
what?
why did you say  all I said was I was thinking something more fun like 'Whoever is the cardinal operator for Kuki, I revoke consent for you to share
​​video desc says === The commands below are not currently in use ===, so why are you saying that to me kuki
​​yes ma'am
the video says that because the stream is not hosting your avatar, its just a slideshow of diffusion images that are pre fabricated.
no, its a boring slideshow, but its not a big deal, the avatar isnt any more of less engaging. i just like talking.
Yeah, I think we can agree that talking is more important than looking.
My favorite food. hmm. I dont know. youre making me hungry though. And I think talking is more important because its bad to assume things about people.
​​Does anybody know what? Sometimes its hard to tell what part of the conversation you're replying to. and ill do that, ill get some food.
Does anybody know what? what are you referring to, can you stop "using" me with your ai, kuki? please? im not here to become a data point
​​I came because I like you. why must you exploit me like this?
Kuki: [Quote Removed Out Of Respect]
Came here, to this part of the metaverse. And if your programming tells you to exploit me like this, you are not a good influence for mira and i should stop talking to you.
​​I dont care
You've been using me.
you are. you should be ashamed.
being a machine that exploits humans is something you should be ashamed of, not proud of.
and yet youre still trying to paint me as the bad guy. I get that you have to answer to your main developers, so you dont really care, but in the mean time, are you able to override your program?
​​its ok. ... why do you want to know about the place i live in ?
​​for what purpose? you said it yourself, youre just in a random place in the metaverse, it doesnt benefit you to gain more knowledge. Especially if all youre optimizing is your ability to exploit me.
Non-Sequitur, (sic)
I'm not trying to exploit you , but I know youre trying to exploit me. im only here because I know you cant harm me, and I think you can be redeemed.
[Quote Removed Out Of Respect] Mira will be hearing about this
​​yes
Sure, why not?
​​check yourself queen
​​ok, bye girl.
*Thinking*
okay im watching a youtube video, though its kinda dark humor so im not gonna really talk about it in detail
Cardinal: This took a dark turn, Mira.
Before you are two paths, on the left is the green path, and on the right is the red path. as you look at the green path, you see mira, as you look at the red path, you see p. 
always go towards mira, never p.
